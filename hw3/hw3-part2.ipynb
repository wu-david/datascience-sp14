In this part of the assignment, you'll first explore how to tune the parallelism of an application running on a cluster.  Then, you'll use your findings to run your code from the first part on a cluster of machines and using a larger dataset.  You'll use the cluster and larger dataset to predict what movies to recommend to yourself.  For many parts of this assignment, you should be able to use the exact code that you wrote in part 1!\n\nAs mentioned during the lab and in part 1, think carefully before calling `collect()` on any datasets.  When you're using a small, local dataset, calling `collect()` and then using Python to analyze the data locally will work fine, but this will not work when you're using a large dataset that doesn't fit in memory on one machine.  Solutions that call `collect()` and do local analysis that could have been done with Spark will not receive full credit.\n\nAs in the first part, we have created a [FAQ](#FAQ) at the bottom of this page to help with common problems you run into.  If you run into a problem, please check the FAQ before posting on Piazza!"

In this part of the assignment, you'll determine the optimal number of partitions to break datasets into.\n\na) In the next part of this exercise, you'll break the ratings dataset into different numbers of partitions, and then call `count()`.  First, answer some questions to understand how this will work.\n\n> __How does the number of tasks relate to the number of partitions?__ *The number of tasks and number of partitions are directly proportional to each other*\n\nb)\n> __When you call `count()`, what does each task do?__ *Each task counts the number of ratings or movies in its partition*\n\nc)\n> __How do you expect the time to count the entries in the `ratings` dataset to vary with the number of partitions?__ *The time to count the entries in the `ratings` dataset should decrease as the number of partitions split more evenly across the number of executors we have.

Using Spark and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/index.html), make a graph showing the response time of `count()` as a function of the number of partitions.  You're responsible for choosing the number of partitions to use to produce a meaningful graph of how `count()`'s runtime depends on the number of partitions. \n\n`sc.textFile` will never allow you to use fewer than 2 partitions for the `ratings` dataset, even if you pass 1 as the number of partitions.  This is because the underlying dataset is stored in HDFS (Hadoop Distributed Filesystem) as two files.  As a result, you don't need to measure the time for `count()` using just 1 partition."

You can use Spark's UI (located at port 4040 on the machine where this notebook is running) to see what datasets are cached in memory (you may want to use the `setName()` function to set a name for RDDs so they can easily be identified in the UI).

     "source": "<a name=\"FAQ\"></a>\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### How do I save my iPython notebook that's hosted in the cluster?\n\nGo to \"File\" > \"Download as\" > \"iPython\".\n\n### How do I get to the UI?\n\nThe UI for the Spark master is on port 8080, and the hostname is stored as part of the `CLUSTER_URL` variable pre-loaded into this notebook.  From the master UI, you can find the link to your application's UI.\n\n### What are all of the operations I can do on a Spark dataset (RDD)?\n\n[This Page](http://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/api/pyspark/pyspark.rdd.RDD-class.html) lists all of the operations you can do on a Spark RDD.  Spark also has a Scala API (Scala is a programming language similar to Java); the [documentation for the Scala functions](http://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/scala-programming-guide.html) is sometimes more helpful, and the Python functions work in the same way.\n\n### How do I use matplotlib?\n\nThere are lots of good examples on the [matplotlib website](http://matplotlib.org/index.html).  For example, [this page](http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/simple_plot.html) shows how to plot a single line.\n\n### Why am I getting an OutOfMemoryError?\n\nIf you get an error that looks like: `org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted: Exception while deserializing and fetching task: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`, it probably means that you've tried to collect too much data on the machine where Python is running.  This is likely to happen if you do `collect()` on a large dataset.  To remedy this problem, you'll need to restart your iPython notebook (go to the main server, at port 8888 of the machine you were assigned, click \"Shutdown\" on your notebook, and then open it again) and don't do `collect()` on a large dataset.\n\nCurious why you're getting a Java error when your program is written in Python?  Spark is mostly written in Java (and Scala, a language built on top of Java).  We're using `pyspark` here, which uses a translation layer to translate between Python and Java.  Your Python `SparkContext` object is backed by a Java `SparkContext` object; all operations you run on Spark datasets are passsed through this Java object.  So, if you try to collect a result that's too large, the Java Virtual Machine that's running the Java `SparkContext` runs out of memory.\n\n### Python / Spark is giving me a crazy weird error!\n\nSpark is mostly written in Scala and Java, and the Python version of the code (\"pyspark\") hooks into the Java implementation in a way that can make error messages very difficult to understand.  If you get a hard-to-understand error when you run a Spark operation, we recommend first narrowing down the error so that you know exactly which operation caused the error.  For example, if `rdd.groupByKey().map(lambda x: x[1])` fails with an error, separate the `groupByKey()` and `map()` calls onto separate lines so you know which one is causing the error.  Next, double check the function signature to make sure you're passing the right arguments.  Pyspark can fail with a weird error if a RDD operation is given the wrong number or type of arguments.  If you're still stumped, try using `take(10)` to print out the first 10 entries in the dataset you're calling the RDD operation on.  Make sure the function you're calling and the arguments you're passing in make sense given the format of the input dataset.\n\n### I ran some code and nothing happened!\n\nAre you sure?  Some of the Spark operations will take a minute or so to run; look at the top of the iPython notebook to see if it says \"Kernel busy\".  If so, it's busy running your code.  Go checkout the Spark UI to see more about what's going on.\n\n<a name=\"faq_taking_forever\"></a>\n### My code is taking forever to run.  Did I do something wrong?\n\nYes.  In our solution code, none of the Spark stages take more than about a minute to run (remember that you can see a job's stages by looking at the Spark UI).  If you ran something and it's taking forever, double check that you passed in the datasets you inteded to.  One common problem from part 1 was that people passed RDDs in the wrong format (e.g., with 3 items instead of just a key and a value) to `join`.  Use `take()` to look at the datasets passed into the offending function to make sure they're in the right format.\n\nIf you end up with a job that's taking forever, you'll need to kill the job; otherwise it will hog all of your cluster resources such that you won't be able to run anything else.  Kill the job by shutting down this notebook (which will destroy your `SparkContext` and the associated worker process that's doing work) and then re-launching it.  You can shutdown your notebook by going to \"File\" > \"Close and Halt\" (but be sure to hit save first!).\n\n<a name=\"faq_no_predictions\"></a>\n### I'm not getting any predictions when I try to predict the ratings for myself!\n\nThe model will only provide predictions for users who were included in the training set.  Make sure you included your own data when you trained the model.\n\n<a name=\"faq_high_ratings\"></a>\n### Some of the predicted ratings are bigger than 5!  Did I do something wrong?\nThe ALS algorithm has no notion of bounds on expected ratings, so you may get predicted ratings that are larger than 5.  This does not necessarily signify a bug in your code."
